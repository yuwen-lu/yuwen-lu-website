                  <h3>Machine Learning-Powered</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our app enabled goalkeepers to record their training videos
                    and replay them, so that they can detect flaws in their
                    practices from an objective view. We also offered
                    personalized training plans for users. More than that, we
                    integrated
                    <strong> Machine Learning classification</strong> to detect
                    the goalkeepers' performed training tasks (left/right dive,
                    jump catch, etc.) and automatically calculate the completion
                    status of their training plans. In the future, we can build
                    other machine learning models to analyse the users'
                    performance such as dive distance and jump height, to offer
                    more professional feedback for their training.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As one developer in the team, I contributed to
                    <strong>building the app using Swift</strong> and
                    <strong
                      >integrated the newly-released Apple ARKit motion
                      detection module</strong
                    >
                    into our machine learning pipeline. I integrated the module
                    to detect human's joint positions in the video frame and fed
                    the data to our LSTM-based model, which conducted the
                    classification.
                  </p>
                  <h3>A User-first Approach</h3>
                  <p>
                    As the Usability Manager of the team, I ensured our app
                    meets the potential users' needs and implemented
                    human-centered design principles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here are some activities we conducted as parts of our
                    user-centered design:

                  <h3> General Assembly Fifth Committee (GA5) — 2018</h3>
                  <p>
                    In 2018, I joined with my partner, Tianran Liu, in the committee GA5 which focused on the administrative and budgetary matters of the UN. The country we were representing was <strong>the Republic of Latvia</strong>, one of the three Baltic countries. Here is our <a href="./documents/GA5_Latvia_A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">position paper</a>. Our topics during the conference were:
                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We ended up focusing on the topic <i>"Strengthening Compliance and Accountability in Field Missions with Special Regard to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Cases"</i> and discussed about the <strong>Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA)</strong> cases in UN Field Missions. We worked on a victim-centered solution with a special focus on female victims. Our final draft resolution was passed by the committee and became part of the <a href="https://www.nmun.org/assets/documents/conference-archives/new-york/2018/ny18a-res-ga5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final resolution.</a>

                  <h3>Commission on Population and Development (CPD) — 2019</h3>
                  <p>
                    In 2019, I, together with my partner Yuchen Lu, joined CPD, one of the ten Functional Commissions of the Economic and Social Council. This time we represented <strong>the Republic of Belarus</strong>. Here is our <a href="./documents/CPD_Belarus_A.pdf" target="_blank">position paper</a>, where we discussed about the following topics for the conference:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Fulfilling the Nutritional Needs of the Ageing Population</li>
                    <li>Addressing the Effects of International Migration on Cities</li>
                    <li><strong>Realizing SDG 3 by Ensuring Access to Essential Health-Care Services and
                      Education</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Our topic during the conference was decided by the body as the third one. That year, I became more familiar with the working style in the conference and the Rules of Procedus, thus more prepared. My partner and I contributed to two draft resolutions, focusing on the use of <strong>eHealth technology</strong> and <strong>mental healthcare</strong>. They were both adopted by the committee and formed the <a href="http://www.nmun.org/assets/documents/conference-archives/new-york/2019/ny19a-res-cpd.pdf">final resolution.</a> It was recognized and archived by <strong>the real United Nations</strong> as part of the young generation's solution to current global issues.</p>
                  <p>Our hard work before and during the conference was also recognized by the dais and our peers with an <strong>Outstanding Delegate</strong> award and a <strong>Best Position Paper</strong> Award (the only two highest awards for individual delegates).</p>

                  <h3>Your Personal Card Manager for Payment</h3>
                  <p>
                    Imagine you have several bank cards and you are paying for the dinner with your crush: American Express has a higher return rate, but Bank of American has a promotion activity with this restaurant... Do you do the calculation to save money, or do you pay randomly to stay cool but risking paying more?

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes people just don't realize how much they are losing for being ignorant of the different promotion activities happening in their local cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. However, with our payment app, the problem is easily solved. Collecting promotion information from differnet sources, our app can <strong>automatically pick the best deal for you and pay with the right card</strong>. No more headaches.
                  </p>
                  <p>Our project participated in the <strong>IBM-ICBC National Fintech Innovation Competition</strong> and won <strong>the 3<sup>rd</sup> prize</strong>. The competition was organized by the tech giant IBM and <strong>China's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</strong> (ICBC). It involved both undergraduate and graduate students and focused on the business values and entrepreneurship of the projects. It lasted months and had 3 rounds of selection, finished with a 24-hour hackathon at the ICBC Data Center in Beijing. It was a fun and unforgettable experience for our team, Lin Yuan, Xiang Xie and I.</p>
                  <p>We all won <strong>an internship opportunity at ICBC development department</strong>, which is <strong>the best among Chinese banks</strong>. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to take it due to schedule conflicts, but I believe in the future our story with IBM and ICBC would continue.</p>
